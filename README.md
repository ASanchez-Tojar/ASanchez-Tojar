### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Alfredo, an evolutionary ecologist combining empirical studies with a lot of evidence synthesis and meta-science.

I share my code here in my GitHub profile, but you can check out more about my interests in my Twitter profile [@ASanchez_Tojar](https://twitter.com/ASanchez_Tojar) or my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=Sh-Rjq8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
