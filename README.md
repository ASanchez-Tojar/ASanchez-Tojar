### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Alfredo, an evolutionary ecologist whose research combines evidence synthesisâ€”primarily **meta-analyses**â€”and **meta-research**, with a touch of empirical studies. I have a soft spot for birds and a strong commitment to Open, Reliable, and Transparent science. I am currently based at Bielefeld University (Germany) and I serve on the Board of Directors of **SORTEE**, where we work to enhance reliability and transparency in science through cultural and institutional changes, which you should check out here: https://www.sortee.org/

I share my code (and data) here in my GitHub profile, but you can check out more about my interests in my profiles:
