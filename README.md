### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Alfredo, an evolutionary ecologist combining evidence synthesis (mostly meta-analyses) and meta-science, with a pinch of empirical studies. I am currently based at Bielefeld University (Germany) and I am a member of the Board of Directors of the Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (SORTEE), which if you should check out here: https://www.sortee.org/

I share my code (and data) here in my GitHub profile, but you can check out more about my interests in my profiles:
